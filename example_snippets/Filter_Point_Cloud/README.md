point_cloud_filter.py is a Python script for a ROS node which takes a point cloud and uses a [Voxel Grid Filter](https://wiki.ros.org/pcl_ros/Tutorials/VoxelGrid%20filtering) to reduce the point cloud's density. You can use this as a starting point and customize it as needed for your specific ROS environment and point cloud topic.

This node subscribes to an input point cloud topic (input_point_cloud), applies a Voxel Grid filter to it, and then publishes the filtered point cloud on an output topic (output_point_cloud). You can customize the voxel size by adjusting the setLeafSize parameters to meet your specific requirements.

Make sure you have the necessary dependencies, including the ROS environment and the PCL (Point Cloud Library) package, installed for this code to work correctly. Additionally, adjust the topics and parameters as needed for your ROS setup.
