You can use OpenCV to stitch two video streams together and publish the combined video. video_stitch.py is a Python ROS node that takes two video topics, stitches the video frames side by side, and publishes the combined video as a new video topic. Make sure you have OpenCV installed for this to work.

In this node:

We create a class VideoStitcherNode that initializes subscribers for the left and right video topics and a publisher for the stitched video topic.

We define callback functions for both left and right image topics that convert the received Image messages to OpenCV images and store them.

The stitch_images method checks if both left and right images are available, and if so, it stitches them side by side using OpenCV's hconcat method.

The resulting stitched image is then converted back to an Image message and published on the /stitched_video topic.

Make sure to adjust the input and output topics ('/left_video_topic', '/right_video_topic', and '/stitched_video') as needed for your ROS setup. Additionally, ensure that the camera parameters and calibration are appropriate for stereo vision to perform image rectification and stitching correctly.
